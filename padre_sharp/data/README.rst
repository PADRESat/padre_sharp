Data directory
==============

This directory contains data files included with the package source
code distribution. Note that this is intended only for relatively small files
- large files should be externally hosted and downloaded as needed.
This directory is NOT for downloaded instrument data unless it is needed for testing purposes.

Calibration files
-----------------

Calibration files are stored in the `calibration` subdirectory.
