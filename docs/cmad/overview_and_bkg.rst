Overview and Background Information
***********************************

This section briefly summarizes the instrument and its objectives to provide its role and importance
within the context of the SMD portfolio.

Science Objectives
==================

This section describes the science objective(s) of the mission.

<Instrument name> Instrument Description
========================================


Measurement Concept
===================
This subsection summarizes the instrument parameters and associated requirements that must
be fulfilled to attain mission success. The types of measurements or observations made as well
as how the instrument executes those measurements are described. A table like the example
below may be included.

+----------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------+
| Parameter      | Minimum Success Criteria   | Comprehensive Success Criteria | Design Goals |
+================+============================+================================+==============+
| Wavelength     | 6 or more emissions to     | 0.1-105 nm                     | 0.1-105 nm   |
| :math:`\lambda`| specify the chromosphere,  |                                |              |
|                | TR, and corona, plus the   |                                |              |
|                | He II 30.4 nm emission     |                                |              |             
+----------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------+
| Time Cadence   |                     60 sec |                    < 20 sec    |       10 sec |

Instrument Subsystem Descriptions
=================================

<Subsystem name>
----------------
This section (and any necessary subsections) provides details on the susbsystems or components
responsible for directly obtaining the measurements or observations pertinent to the instrument. Details
on the layout and design of the subsystem, examples of expected measurements, and interactions with
any other subsystems should be provided.

<Instrument name> Heritage
--------------------------

Subsystem Heritage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This section summarizes any heritage from past missions for the instrument and its subsystems or
components (e.g., detectors, cameras, signal processing electronics).

Algorithm and Calibration Heritage
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This section identifies any heritage from past missions for the algorithms used to process/convert detector
signals into the measurable quantities needed to meet the science requirements.
