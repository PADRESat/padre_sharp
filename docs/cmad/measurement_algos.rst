SHARP Measurement Algorithm Description
***************************************************

Theoretical basis
=================
This section provides context and background information for the quantity or phenomenon
being detected. The algorithms and techniques used are described, with pertinent equations
and references included. Logical groupings (i.e., separate subsections) may be used for clarity of
the concepts introduced.

Conversion of Instrument Signals to <Measurable units>
======================================================

Measurement Equations
---------------------
This subsection (one for each subsystem) describes the equations used to derive measurable
quantities from raw instrument signals.

Signal Estimates and Error Analyses for Subsystems
==================================================

<Subsystem name> Signal Estimates and Error Analysis
----------------------------------------------------
This subsection (one for each subsystem) provides details on the expected signal values for
the instrument subsystem. This can be expressed graphically. A table summarizing the
“acceptable” values—that is, the minimum values that would meet mission requirements
and be deemed still usable to meet the mission’s science objectives—as well as the
estimated uncertainty in the measured values and the error budget allowable for each
parameter may be included. The equations for determining the uncertainties should be
included.

Preflight Calibration Algorithms
================================
This section describes the process for calibrating the instrument prior to shipment and/or
installation. It may refer back to measurement equations detailed earlier in the document and
identify the specific variables being solved for in order to determine proper calibration.
